Activity 1:
Select and discuss three risk management methodologies in the context of cyber risk management. The methedologies to be examined are:
- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Monte Carlo Simulation

Answer:
- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FEMA) is a method used to identify and assess possible failures in a system, and to help understand their effects. FEMA has a few core steps. First, failures in the system are identified by analysing the different components such as hardware failures, software vulnerabilities, or simple human error. Then, the effect of these failures are evaluated against the system's overall security, from how impactful a data breach could be, to system downtime, and malicious unauthorised access. Finally, the possible failures are given a Risk Prioirty Number based on it's severity, occurence, and detectability, helping to prioritise the potential risks.
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a method used to assess the possible impacts and disruptions to important business processes. Similar to FEMA, BIA has a few important steps. First, the critical business functions of the organisation are identified, and the ones most vulnerable to cyber incidents are highlighted. Then, the potential consequences of a cyber attack on these critical functions are analysed and assessed. This can be done by listing the financial, operational, and reputational impacts of cyber attack results. Finally, strategies are created to recover from possible cyber attacks, such as redundant backups, disaster plans, and other procedures. These help the organisation return critical business functions to working order as quickly as possible.
- Monte Carlo Simulations are a method that uses statistical modeling and random samples to calculate the probability of different outcomes in a cyber attack. First, a model is developed that simulates the organisation's systems and the potential cyber risks. This includes the likelyhood of different attacks or internal failures. Then, the simulation is run using random sampling, so as to generate a range of possible outcomes. Multiple simulations help estimate the probability and the impact of different attack scenarios. Finally, using these simulated scenarios and probabilities, a risk analysis is performed on their impacts. This allows prioritised preventative strategies to be put in place around the most likely scenarios first.
