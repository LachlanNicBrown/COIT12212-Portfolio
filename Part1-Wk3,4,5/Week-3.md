Activity 1: Create a table of the top five biggest cyber events in the last five years by searching on informationisbeautiful.net.

Answer:

| Incident Name and Year | Brief Event Story | Impact | Type of Atack |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| Indonesian SIM Cards - 2022 | Approximately 1.3 billion SIM card registrations (including ID numbers, phone numbers, and more) were obtained in a breach of the various Governmental bodies. The Indonesian government has a history of poor coordination and security around citizen's data. | 1.3 billion SIM card registrations  | Hacking of "patchwork [...] data security". Vector unknown. |
| Shanghai Police - 2022 | A database containing ~1 billion entries for home address, ID numbers, and more were obtained with leaked credentials to a police server. | ~1 billion entries of a police database | Breach via leaked credentials and a "bug in an Elastic Search deployment". |
| Ticketmaster - 2024 | Approximately 560 million database entries containing names, addresses, partial credit card data, and more was obtained in a breach of Ticketmaster's owner Live Nation. Cloud service provider Snowflake was reported to have noticed an increase in threat activity targeting some of it's customers, such as Ticketmaster. | 560 million entries of customer information | Hacking of a cloud-based database. Vector unknown. |
| Facebook - 2021 | Approximately 530 million users' names, emails, addresses, etc. were released on a forum. The data was several years old and was from previously scraped information prior to a vulnerability patch in 2019. | 530 million entries of older user data, which could be used for phishing or social manipulation | Misuse of bots to scrape data due to an unknown vulnerability. |
| Syniverse - 2021 | An unknown amount, but possibly around 500 million users with breached call/SMS data over a period of years due to unauthorised access to an internal database/transfer environment of mobile exchange company Syniverse. Call records, user locations, and text message content could have been accessed. | Estimates of around 500 million users having their call/text data breached over a period of 5 years. | Hacking of a system that allowed access to the company's data transfer environment, without discovery over approx. 5 years. |

Activity 2: Research the following topics and write one paragraph about each:
- Threat Intelligence
- STIX and TAXII

Answer:
Threat intelligence is the collection, investigation, and sharing of information about current cyber threats. Understanding the tactics, techniques, vectors, etc of threat actors, the vulnerabilities in systems and the potential impacts that these vulnerabilities could have if exploited. By using the information gained and examined from threat intelligence, organisations can harden and proactively respond to attacks, or mitigate them altogether.

Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are frameworks designed to improve the shareing of cyber threat intelligence. STIX acts as a common language for cyber threat information, which allows for easier and standardised descriptions of threat actors, attack types, and other data. TAXII includes the secure and automated exchange of this data to and from different enities.

- PnG
- Security Cards

Answer:

Activity 4: Describe the following concepts in one paragraph each:
- Cyber Kill Chain
- MITRE ATT&CK

Answer:
The cyber kill chain is a framework designed by Lockheed MArtin to understand and defend against cyber threats by describing the stages of a cyber attack. There are seven steps: recon, weaponisation, delivery, exploitation, instalation, command and control, and actions on objectives. These stages represent a step in an attack's proccess, starting with gathering information about a system, implementing an exploit or social manipulation, to executing the goal of the attack. These stages can help break down and understand an attack and can help detect, prevent, or stop parts of the chain.

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a framework that extensively lists tactics, techniques, and proceedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. It is available globally and is organised into different tactics and techniques broken down across different stages of a potential attack. MITRE ATT&CK can be used to keep up to date with current threat detection and incident response, and in assessing the security of systems.
